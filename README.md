# AspNetMicroServices
<h1>Microservices architecture and implementation on .Net</h1>

There is a little project which implements an e-commerce application that has four modules: Catalog, Basket, Discount, and Ordering. Each one is a microservice with a relational database SQL (PostgreSQL or SQL Server) and NoSQL (MongoDB or Redis). Also, I use Event Driven Communication with RabbitMQ and Ocelot API Getway.
